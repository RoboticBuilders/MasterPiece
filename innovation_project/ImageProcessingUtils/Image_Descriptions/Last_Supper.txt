Last Supper is one of the most famous artworks in the world, painted by Leonardo da Vinci probably between 1495 and 1498 for a monastery in Milan. It depicts a dramatic scene described in the Bible where Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him.

Leonardo’s version appears neatly arranged, with Jesus at the centre of an extensive table and the Apostles to his left and right. He wears the traditional red and blue robes and has a beard, but Leonardo did not imbue him with the customary halo. Jesus’ serene composure, with his head and eyes lowered, contrasts with the agitation of the Apostles. Their varying postures rise, fall, extend, and intertwine while remaining organized in groups of three.

The meal takes place within an almost austere room so that the viewer focuses on the action taking place in the foreground. Dark tapestries line the walls on either side, while the back wall is dominated by three windows that look out to Milan’s countryside.
