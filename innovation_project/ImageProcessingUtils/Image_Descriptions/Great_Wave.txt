The Great Wave off Kanagawa is a woodblock print by Japanese artist Hokusai and is part of the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. 

Created in 1831, the print depicts three boats moving through a storm-tossed sea, with a large wave forming a spiral near the top-left and Mount Fuji appearing in the background slightly below the center. Hokusai may have wished to depict a fear of and respect for the ocean with this play on perspective. 

The outline of the boats, while clear in the painting, is not as apparent in the tactile version.
