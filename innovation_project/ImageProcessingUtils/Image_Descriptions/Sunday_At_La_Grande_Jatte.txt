A Sunday on La Grande Jatte is a painting by French artist Georges Seurat. It depicts people relaxing in a suburban park on an island in the Seine River called La Grande Jatte, a popular retreat for the middle and upper class of Paris in the 19th century.

Some 40 figures crowd the canvas with the river appearing on the top-left. The figures appear static and frozen in an uncommunicative proximity. Many figures have been identified as known Parisian stereotypes from the time.
