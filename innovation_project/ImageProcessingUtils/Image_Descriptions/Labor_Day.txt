The painting depicts two people, likely a man and woman, relaxing on a covered outdoor deck,
looking out at the water around them. The water is surrounded by land, with lush green forests covering it. 
Its a sunny day and the sun is reflecting off the water. 
There is a brown table between them, and the woman is resting her feet on it. She is tapping something against her mouth, 
potentially a pen. The woman is wearing a blue shirt, tan pants and light-blue socks, meanwhile, 
the man is wearing a dark-blue jacket and tan shorts. The deck has a gray, solid floor and silver railings and supports.
