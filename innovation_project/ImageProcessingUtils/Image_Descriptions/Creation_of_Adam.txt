The Creation of Adam is a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man.

God is depicted as an elderly white-bearded man on the top right, wrapped in a swirling cloak while Adam, on the lower left, is completely naked. God's right arm is outstretched to impart the spark of life from his own finger into that of Adam, whose left arm is extended in a pose mirroring God's. God is surrounded by 12 figures believed to include Eve and her progeny.
